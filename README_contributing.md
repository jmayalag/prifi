## How to contribute

This repository uses Travis CI to check continually that the code is bug-free and compliant to coding standards. No one can push to `master` directly.

A typical workflow would be :

```
$ git clone github.com/dedis/prifi

[do great improvements]

$ git commit -am "I did great changes!"
$ git push
To github.com:dedis/prifi.git
 ! [remote rejected] master -> master (protected branch hook declined)
```

Your work was rejected, as you are trying to push to master.

```
git checkout -b my-branch
git push -u origin my-branch
```

You can now check in [https://github.com/lbarman/prifi/commits/my-branch](https://github.com/lbarman/prifi/commits/my-branch) that integration tests passed (green check). A yellow dot means that the tests are still running.

Regardless of the result, you can create a new pull request (base: `master`, compare: `my-branch`), and continue commiting changes. When all integration tests passes, you will be able to merge the pull request into master.

## Contributing rules

The code is checked with the following tools : 
```
go fmt
go vet
golint*
go test
```

If any of those tool exit with status 1, the code will be qualified as "non-compliant" by Travis.

*For `golint`, we add the following exceptions (i.e., we remove the original constraints) :
- Variables with underscores (`G_s`) are now allowed
- `ALL_CAPS_VARIABLES` are now allowed
- Comments for `FieldXYZ` do not need to start with `FieldXYZ...`

Additionnally, we ignore all files 
- finishing by `_test.go`
- in `.deprecated` folders

One can run the tests locally with `make all` and/or `make test_verbose`
